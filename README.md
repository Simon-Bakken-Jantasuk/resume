# Will's Résumé

My personal resume written in Groff. It is designed to be a simple template for building clean, professional resumes. It is based on the [FAANGPath resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc) with a few stylistic changes.

# Customisation

Individual customisation takes place in `WillCashmanResume.ms` whereas the main formatting and styling is done in the macro file `resume.tmac`.

After changing `WillCashmanResume.ms`, simply run `make` to update your changes in `WillCashmanResume.pdf`.
